# Erste Sandbox Example Exchange rate APIs

Welcome to the example Erste Sandbox APIs, brought to you by the Innovations team at Erste Digital!
While you are encouraged to develop your own custom servers and play aroud with the APIs we documented for you, this repository is here to help you start.
In the codebase, you can find a basic setup for a Node.js + Express server, along with several endpoints connected to exchange rates.
Happy coding!

## Initialization

To start the development server, all you need to do is follow these easy steps:

1. Install relevant dependencies:

```
npm install
```

2. Run the hot-reload Nodemon server:

```
npm run dev
```
